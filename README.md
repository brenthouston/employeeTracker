## Description
   This is a dynamic user interface application for a company to track it's employees thier rolse and departments.  The user can Create, Read, Update, and Delete all information that is stored in the department, role and employee data groups. I learned about SQL interface using mysql2 and how to integrate inquirer prompts for user interaction. I also used tablify, which is an npm package that helps in formatting the data in node.js for ease of use.
